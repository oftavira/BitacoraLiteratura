    "It has been reported that in some food samples, Raman scattering may be masked by the presence of fluoresence signal in the experiment. To avoid this situation, there is a proposal of using Fourier Transform Raman Spectroscopy and Nd:YAG near IR as an excitation source, along with other techniques such as Surface Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy, Confocal Raman MIcrospectroscopy, and Raman Image Spectroscopy, latest techniques are suitable as they provide a way to make studys at very low concentration"
